											<h2>Introduction</h2>
											<p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
                                               These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change,
                                               primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases;
                                               these in turn cause intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels,
                                               melting glaciers and warming oceans which can harm animals, destroy the places they live,
                                               and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods and communities. As climate change worsens,
                                               dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent or severe.</p>
                                               
                                            <h2>Problem</h2>
                                            <p>In order to mitigate the risk associated with climate change our clients are building around lessening their environmental impact or carbon footprint by offering products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable,
                                               in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. 
                                               This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their service may be received. </p>

                                            <h2>Objectives</h2>
                                            <p>Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives our client access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.</p>
                                            <p>We were tasked with creating a sentiment analysis model that will be able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.</p>
                                            <p>In order to achieve the objectives, we did the following:</p>
                                            <p>-Analyse the supplied data</p>  
                                            <p>-Identify potential errors in the data and clean the existing data set</p>       
                                            <p>-Determine if additional features can be added to enrich the data set</p>      
                                            <p>-Build a model that is capable of predicting tweet</p>      
                                            <p>-Evaluate the accuracy of the best machine learning model</p>         
                                            <p>-Determine what features were most important in the modelâ€™s prediction decision</p>        
                                            <p>-Explain the inner working of the model to a non-technical audience</p>
